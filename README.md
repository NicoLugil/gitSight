The initial goal of this project is to be able to visualize git issue statistiscs for gitlab projects.

# installation

For now the code isn't nicely packaged yet. Install by 
- downloading the repo
- making sure you have the packages in requirements.txt, these are the versions that have been tested. Since we use very basic functionality, earlier versions are very likely to work as well
- set the correct PYTHONPATH (to the main repo path, for example `export PYTHONPATH=~/projects/gitSight`)



We are only getting started...
